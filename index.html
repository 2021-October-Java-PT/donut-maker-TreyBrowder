                <p id="about-me-info">
                 My experience as a personal and as a group fitness coach has taught me the value in hardwork    and in being discipline.It also helped me hone my communication and relationship building skills.  Currently I'm building my portfolio as a software developer through a bootcamp course at We Can Code It.  In my free time I like to workout and I like to practice skills I've learned through the course. In addition to that I like to plan out my path to becoming more knowlegable as a developer. As a coach I was designing workouts and nutrition plans, and now here I am building full stack web applications. I'm looking forward to furthering my knowlege and continuing to grow as a software developer
